Have you ever been troubled by the large number of merged `feature/`, `fix/`, or `hotfix/` branches in your project? Manually checking and deleting them one by one is both tedious and error-prone.

**This tool is your solution!** It automates the process of finding, checking, and interactively cleaning up branches that have served their purpose, keeping your repository tidy.

## Demo

Here is a demonstration of the tool in action:

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Smart Discovery**: Automatically scans and lists all local and remote branches that match a specified prefix (e.g., `feature/`).
*   **Accurate Merge Checking**: Uses `git merge-base --is-ancestor` for its core logic, ensuring that only branches **fully merged** into the target are marked for deletion. This avoids potential misjudgments from `git branch --merged` in complex histories.
*   **Interactive & Safe Deletion**: Prompts for confirmation for each merged branch, giving you the final say and preventing accidental deletion of important branches.
*   **Unified Local & Remote Handling**: No need to differentiate between local and remote. The tool auto-detects the existence of each and uses a safe deletion order (local first, then remote).
*   **Input Persistence**: Remembers the last branch prefix and target branch you used. Next time, just press Enter to reuse them, significantly improving efficiency.
*   **Pre-run Safety Checks**: Before performing any actions, the script verifies:
    *   If the current directory is a Git repository.
    *   If the target branch has uncommitted or unpushed changes, preventing operations on an inconsistent state.
*   **Clear Summary Report**: After execution, it provides a detailed, categorized report showing which branches were deleted, skipped by the user, or kept because they were unmerged.
*   **Color-coded Output**: Uses different colors to distinguish between states (success, warning, error), making the output easy to read at a glance.

## üöÄ Installation

You can install the script using any of the following methods.

### Option 1: Using curl (Recommended)

Open your terminal and run the following command to download the script and make it executable.

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO with your actual details
curl -o git-cleanup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/git-cleanup.sh
chmod +x git-cleanup.sh
```
> **Tip**: To use the script from anywhere, move it to a directory included in your system's `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.
> ```bash
> # Optional: Make it globally accessible
> sudo mv git-cleanup.sh /usr/local/bin/git-cleanup
> ```

### Option 2: Manual Download

1.  Find the script file `git-cleanup.sh` in this repository.
2.  Click the "Raw" button, then copy the entire content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C).
3.  Create a new file on your local machine, paste the content, and save it as `git-cleanup.sh`.
4.  In your terminal, grant it executable permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod +x git-cleanup.sh
    ```

## üí° Usage

1.  **Navigate to your Git repository**:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
2.  **Run the script**:
    *   If it's in the current directory: `./git-cleanup.sh`
    *   If installed globally: `git-cleanup`
3.  **Follow the prompts**:
    *   **Enter the branch prefix**: e.g., `feature/`, `fix/`, or `hotfix-`.
    *   **Enter the target branch**: e.g., `develop`, `main`, or `master`. This is the base branch for checking if others are merged.
    *   For each merged branch, type `y` or `Y` to confirm deletion, or simply press Enter to skip.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

*   **Memory File**: The script creates a file at `~/.git_cleanup_script.conf` in your home directory to store your last inputs. You can edit or delete this file at any time.
*   **Remote Name**: The script defaults to using `origin` as the remote name. If your remote is named something else, you can change the `REMOTE_NAME` variable at the top of the script.
